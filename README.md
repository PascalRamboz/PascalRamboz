- 👋 Hi, I’m @PascalRamboz
- 👀 I’m interested in open source engineering. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning K8s. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on K8s and jmeter. 
- 📫 How to reach me : PascalRamboz@hotmail.com

I am writing to you as, despite following the listed steps and commands to apply, it seems your K8s+jmeter project does not work for whatever reason, at least on docker desktop built on top of WSL deployed on a windows 10 OS. 
Anyway I am very grateful to you for what you pushed on docker+jmeter starter kit which works well, good job on that :) !
